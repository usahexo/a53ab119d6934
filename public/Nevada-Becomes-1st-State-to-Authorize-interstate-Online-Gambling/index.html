        <h1 id="Nevada-Becomes-1st-State-to-Authorize-interstate-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Becomes-1st-State-to-Authorize-interstate-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Becomes 1st State to Authorize interstate Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Becomes 1st State to Authorize interstate Online Gambling</h1><p>Nevada has moved to authorize interstate online gambling, becoming the first U.S. state to do so. The Nevada Senate voted 21-0 on Monday to pass a bill that would allow licensed gambling operators in the state to partner with those in other states that also have legalized gambling.</p>
<p>“This is an important day for the state of Nevada, as we pave the way for more economic opportunities and jobs in our gaming industry, while ensuring our regulatory framework is robust and respected,” said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval in a statement following the vote.</p>
<p>The bill will now go to the desk of Sandoval, who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect immediately upon signature.</p>
<p>Proponents of the measure argue that it will help bolster the struggling casino industry in Nevada, which has seen revenues decline in recent years due to competition from surrounding states that have also legalized gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of interstate online gambling argue that it could lead to increased incidence of problem gambling and organized crime. They also contend that it could be difficult for states to enforce regulations governing such activities across borders.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-amp-New-Jersey-join-Nevada-in-legalizing-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-amp-New-Jersey-join-Nevada-in-legalizing-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware &amp; New Jersey join Nevada in legalizing online gambling"></a>Delaware &amp; New Jersey join Nevada in legalizing online gambling</h1><p>In a major victory for the burgeoning online gambling industry, Delaware and New Jersey have both legalized online gambling. The two states join Nevada in allowing people to gamble online, provided they are physically located within their respective borders.</p>
<p>While it is not clear yet how much revenue the new laws will generate, they are likely to be a boon to the industry. Delaware’s lottery director says that his state’s move could potentially add $7 million in annual revenue, while New Jersey anticipates taking in around $1.3 billion per year.</p>
<p>The big question now is whether other states will follow suit. So far, there has been little movement on this front, but with more and more states legalizing online gambling, it seems only a matter of time before the rest of the country catches up.</p>
<p>For casino operators, this is good news indeed. The growth of online gambling represents a major opportunity for the industry, and with more states coming on board, that opportunity is only going to grow bigger.</p>
<h1 id="Congress-weighs-in-on-online-gambling-but-will-anything-actually-happen"><a href="#Congress-weighs-in-on-online-gambling-but-will-anything-actually-happen" class="headerlink" title="Congress weighs in on online gambling, but will anything actually happen?"></a>Congress weighs in on online gambling, but will anything actually happen?</h1><p>The US Congress is discussing regulating online gambling. The House of Representatives and the Senate separately announced hearings on Tuesday to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>But will any actual change happen?</p>
<p>There are a few potential things at stake. One is that lawmakers may look to shield states from any potential legal issues with interstate gambling. Another is that there may be moves to allow casinos to operate online, or restrictions on how they can do so. And lawmakers might also try to impose some sort of federal levy on gambling profits.</p>
<p>But it’s not clear if any of these proposals will make it into law, or what form they might take if they do. There are already lobbyists plying their trade in favor and against such measures, and it’s likely that the horse-trading involved in crafting legislation will lead to all sorts of compromises and unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’s a good chance that some kind of change will happen sooner rather than later. Online gambling is a huge business, and one that continues to grow. The UK Gambling Commission estimates that the market was worth £4.5 billion ($5.9 billion) in 2017, and it’s expected to reach £11.5 billion ($15.3 billion) by 2023. That’s a lot of money at stake, and no doubt plenty of people with a vested interest in seeing the status quo maintained.</p>

Getty</p>
<p>In the latest sign that the online gambling market is booming, Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts are both planning to apply for online gambling licenses in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Caesars, which already offers online gambling in Nevada and Delaware, said Wednesday that it will apply for a license in New Jersey next week. MGM Resorts announced its plans earlier this month.</p>
<p>The moves come as other casinos also seek a piece of the action. Wynn Resorts, for example, has teamed up with Atlantic City’s Borgata casino to offer online gambling. And Las Vegas Sands has partnered with Britain’s Grosvenor Casinos to offer online poker in the U.K.</p>
<p>The growth of online gambling comes as no surprise given the huge potential market. A study by research firm H2 Gambling Capital estimates that global revenue from online gambling will reach $41 billion by 2020, up from $21 billion last year.</p>
<p>That potential is drawing in even more investors: Earlier this month, social media giant Facebook announced plans to enter the online gambling market through a partnership with British bookmaker William Hill.</p>
<p>Caesars’ move into New Jersey could be a big boost for the state’s struggling casino industry. Atlantic City has been losing casino revenue due to competition from casinos in neighboring states. The addition of online gambling could help stem some of those losses.</p>
