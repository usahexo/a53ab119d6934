<h1 id="How-to-File-a-Gambling-Complaint-with-the-VFW"><a href="#How-to-File-a-Gambling-Complaint-with-the-VFW" class="headerlink" title="How to File a Gambling Complaint with the VFW"></a>How to File a Gambling Complaint with the VFW</h1><p>If you feel like you have been wronged while gambling at a VFW, you may want to consider filing a gambling complaint. This guide will walk you through the process of filing a gambling complaint with the VFW so that you can get the help and justice that you deserve.</p>
<p>The first thing that you need to do is gather evidence of your complaint. This evidence can include documentation of your bets, winnings, and losses, as well as any communication that you have had with the VFW about the issue. Once you have gathered this evidence, you will need to create a written complaint. Your written complaint should include the following information: </p>
<p>-Your name<br>-The name of the VFW where the issue occurred<br>-The date and time of the incident<br>-A detailed description of what happened<br>-Proof of your losses and winnings<br>-Any other relevant information</p>
<p>Once your written complaint is complete, send it to the VFW national headquarters. You can find their contact information on their website. You should also keep a copy of your complaint for your own records.</p>
<p>The VFW will review your complaint and determine if they need to take action. If they decide that there was wrongdoing on the part of the VFW, they will take appropriate action. This could include fining the VFW or suspending their gambling license. However, it is important to note that not all complaints are upheld, so there is no guarantee that you will be successful in getting justice through this process. But it is definitely worth trying if you feel like you have been wronged while gambling at a VFW establishment.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-VFW-Fights-Gambling-Complaints"><a href="#Florida-VFW-Fights-Gambling-Complaints" class="headerlink" title="Florida VFW Fights Gambling Complaints"></a>Florida VFW Fights Gambling Complaints</h1><p>The Florida Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) is in the midst of a legal battle with the state government over allegations of illegal gambling at its Posts.<br>The organization has been in operation for more than 100 years, and its 2,000 members include current and former members of the military who have served in combat zones around the world.</p>
<p>But it now faces the possibility of being shut down after several members filed complaints with state officials alleging that the VFW was operating slot machines and other forms of gambling without a license.</p>
<p>Florida law prohibits any form of gambling that is not specifically authorized by the state, and officials say they are investigating the allegations.</p>
<p>In a statement, VFW National Commander Brian Duffy said the organization “fully intends to fight any and all accusations brought against us.” </p>
<p>He added that the VFW provides important services to veterans and their families, including helping them find employment, housing and medical care.<br>“To be accused of wrongdoing that could potentially close our Posts – and hurt so many – is heartbreaking,” Duffy said.</p>
<p>The issue has also spawned controversy within the VFW ranks, with some members arguing that the organization should contest the allegations while others say it should cooperate with authorities and accept any penalties that may be imposed. </p>
<p>Whatever course of action it takes, the VFW is sure to face a difficult legal battle. Gambling is a heavily regulated industry in Florida, and violators can face significant fines and even imprisonment.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-complaints-land-Florida-VFW-in-hot-water"><a href="#Gambling-complaints-land-Florida-VFW-in-hot-water" class="headerlink" title="Gambling complaints land Florida VFW in hot water"></a>Gambling complaints land Florida VFW in hot water</h1><p>The Florida Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) is in hot water after numerous gambling complaints were filed against the organization.</p>
<p>According to reports, the VFW was operating a casino inside of their building, which was resulting in complaints from local residents. The casino allegedly featured games like blackjack, poker, and roulette, and was open to the public seven days a week.</p>
<p>In response to the complaints, the VFW has agreed to close down the casino. They have also issued an apology to anyone who may have been affected by their actions.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that the VFW has faced trouble over their gambling operations. In 2016, they were ordered to pay $2 million as part of a settlement with the state of Missouri.</p>
<h1 id="Is-your-VFW-gambling-away-your-membership"><a href="#Is-your-VFW-gambling-away-your-membership" class="headerlink" title="Is your VFW gambling away your membership?"></a>Is your VFW gambling away your membership?</h1><p>It’s no secret that some veterans organizations, like the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), enjoy casino-style gambling. In fact, some post commanders may even encourage it as a way to bring in extra money. But is this putting your membership at risk?</p>
<p>There’s no question that gambling can be addictive and destructive. For many veterans, the allure of easy money can be too much to resist, leading to financial ruin. And for VFW members, this could mean the end of their affiliation with the organization.</p>
<p>In states where gambling is legal, the VFW has been known to set up casinos and other gaming operations. These ventures often bring in significant profits, but they also come with a risk of losing members who get sucked into gambling addiction.</p>
<p>In addition to the potential for addiction, there are also concerns about how much money these casinos are making. Some post commanders may be tempted to use casino profits for their own personal gain, rather than using them for the benefit of veterans. This would be a clear violation of VFW bylaws and could lead to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer? Should veterans organizations stay away from casino-style gambling altogether? Or can it be done responsibly, with measures in place to protect members from addiction andcorruption?</p>
<p>That’s a question that each individual organization will have to answer for itself. But it’s clear that gambling can be a risky venture, with the potential to harm both individuals and organizations alike.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="New-Egyptian-Tax-Laws-Allow-Winnings-to-be-Used-as-Lump-Sum"><a href="#New-Egyptian-Tax-Laws-Allow-Winnings-to-be-Used-as-Lump-Sum" class="headerlink" title="New Egyptian Tax Laws Allow Winnings to be Used as Lump Sum"></a>New Egyptian Tax Laws Allow Winnings to be Used as Lump Sum</h1><p>The Egyptian government has recently announced that citizens are now allowed to use their winnings from the lottery, or other gambling activities, as a lump sum payment on their taxes. The change in the law is expected to bring in an extra $2.5 billion in revenue each year for the government.</p>
<p>The amendment to the tax law was made by the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, and it will apply to all forms of gambling, including lotteries, horse racing, and casino games. The winnings can be used either to pay the entire amount of your taxes owed, or as a down payment on your taxes with the remainder paid over a period of time.</p>
<p>This new amendment comes as part of a series of measures being put in place by the Egyptian government in an effort to increase tax revenue. In addition to this change, taxes on income and business profits have also been increased.</p>
<p>Egypt is not alone in its efforts to increase tax revenue from gambling activities. Countries around the world are increasingly looking at ways to tap into this potential source of income. For example, Singapore has introduced a new “corrective tax” on gambling operators which is aimed at reducing problem gambling and generating additional revenue.</p>
<p>The move by the Egyptian government is likely to be welcomed by taxpayers who have been struggling under increasing economic pressures in recent years. It is also likely to be popular with gamblers who now have another way to reduce their tax bill.</p>
<h1 id="Egypt-Announces-New-Tax-Rules-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Egypt-Announces-New-Tax-Rules-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Egypt Announces New Tax Rules for Gambling Winnings"></a>Egypt Announces New Tax Rules for Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Egyptian government has announced that it is introducing new tax rules for gambling winnings. The new rules come into effect on 1 January 2019 and will see gambling winnings taxed at a rate of 20%.</p>
<p>Under the old rules, gambling winnings were not considered taxable income. This meant that players could keep all of their winnings without having to pay any tax on them. However, the new rules mean that players will now have to pay 20% of their winnings in taxes.</p>
<p>This is likely to be a unpopular move among gamblers in Egypt, as it will result in them having to pay more tax on their winnings. However, the government has said that the new rules are necessary in order to generate additional revenue for the country.</p>
<h1 id="Egypt-Introduces-Lump-Sum-Option-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Egypt-Introduces-Lump-Sum-Option-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Egypt Introduces Lump Sum Option for Gambling Winnings"></a>Egypt Introduces Lump Sum Option for Gambling Winnings</h1><p>======</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the government of Egypt announced a new policy that will allow people to collect their gambling winnings in a single lump sum payment. The new option is available for all types of gambling, including lotteries, horse races, and casinos.</p>
<p>The decision was made in an effort to attract more tourists to the country and boost its struggling economy. Egypt has been struggling since the 2011 revolution, and the introduction of this new policy is hoped to revive the tourism industry.</p>
<p>Critics say that the policy is likely to benefit only wealthy gamblers, as most people do not have enough money to cover a large lump sum payout. Others argue that it will simply encourage more people to gamble, leading to even greater losses for the country.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no official statement from the government on how much money it expects to raise from this new policy.</p>
<h1 id="Egypt-Shifts-to-Taxable-Gambling-Winnings-with-Lump-Sum-Option"><a href="#Egypt-Shifts-to-Taxable-Gambling-Winnings-with-Lump-Sum-Option" class="headerlink" title="Egypt Shifts to Taxable Gambling Winnings with Lump Sum Option"></a>Egypt Shifts to Taxable Gambling Winnings with Lump Sum Option</h1><p>The Egyptian government has approved a bill to levy taxes on gambling winnings, but with a lump-sum option for high rollers.</p>
<p>The new law, which was published in the country’s official gazette on Sunday, will see taxes levied on all gambling winnings, regardless of the amount. However, those who earn more than 500,000 Egyptian pounds (USD $28,000) in a year can choose to pay tax on their entire income in a single lump sum.</p>
<p>The measure is designed to encourage high-rollers to stay in Egypt and invest their money in the country’s casinos, which have been struggling in the face of competition from neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
<p>Under the new law, individuals earning less than 500,000 EGP will be taxed at a rate of 20%, while those earning more will be taxed at a rate of 25%. The government says that around 1.5 million Egyptians currently gamble, with the industry worth an estimated 6 billion EGP (USD $336 million) per year.</p>
<p>The decision to levy taxes on gambling winnings comes as part of a wider effort by the Egyptian government to boost its coffers. In March it announced plans to introduce value-added tax (VAT) of 13% on a wide range of goods and services from July 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Taxing-Gambling-Winnings-in-Egypt-Lump-Sum-or-Annual-Payment"><a href="#Taxing-Gambling-Winnings-in-Egypt-Lump-Sum-or-Annual-Payment" class="headerlink" title="Taxing Gambling Winnings in Egypt: Lump Sum or Annual Payment?"></a>Taxing Gambling Winnings in Egypt: Lump Sum or Annual Payment?</h1><p>Since gambling is considered a sin in Islam, Egypt has been hesitant to tax gambling winnings. In the past, any winnings were considered a gift from Allah and were not taxed. However, this exemption is no longer appropriate in today’s economy.</p>
<p>Gambling winnings should be taxed as regular income. There are a few possible ways to tax these winnings: a lump sum when the winnings are received, or an annual payment over a number of years. The most important factor to consider is how much revenue the government would stand to gain from taxing these winnings.</p>
<p>A lump sum tax would be simpler to administer, but it would likely result in less revenue for the government than an annual payment plan. Taxing gambling winnings as regular income would ensure that the government gets its fair share of the money won by gamblers. It would also help to discourage people from gambling, as they would know that they would have to pay taxes on their winnings.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to the government of Egypt to decide how best to tax gambling winnings. However, it is clear that something needs to be done in order to generate more revenue for the country. Gambling winnings represent a valuable source of income that should not be ignored any longer.</p>

        <h1 id="New-Casino-Planned-for-Virginia-Beach"><a href="#New-Casino-Planned-for-Virginia-Beach" class="headerlink" title="New Casino Planned for Virginia Beach"></a>New Casino Planned for Virginia Beach</h1><p>The announcement of a new casino in Virginia Beach has excitement brewing in the city. The $250 million project is planned for the Oceanfront and is expected to create over 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The casino will be operated by MGM Resorts International, which already operates casinos in Las Vegas, Detroit, and National Harbor near Washington D.C. The company is also working on a casino in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>MGM has not released many details about the Virginia Beach casino yet, but officials say that it will be different from their other properties. It will have a unique design and focus on poker and table games rather than slot machines.</p>
<p>Mayor Bobby Dyer is optimistic about the new casino. He believes that it will help to attract more tourists to Virginia Beach and support the local economy.</p>
<p>The news of the casino comes as welcome relief to some locals who have been struggling since the closure of the Atlantic Club Casino in 2014. That casino employed over 1,000 people before it closed down.</p>
<p>There has been some opposition to the new casino, with some residents arguing that it will cause traffic congestion and increase crime rates. However, most people seem to be in favor of it and are looking forward to its opening in 2020.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-on-the-Rise-in-Virginia"><a href="#Gambling-on-the-Rise-in-Virginia" class="headerlink" title="Gambling on the Rise in Virginia"></a>Gambling on the Rise in Virginia</h1><p>Gambling is a popular pastime in the United States, and Virginians are no exception. According to recent reports, gambling is on the rise in Virginia, with more people than ever before betting on sporting events, playing the slots, and hitting the jackpot at the casino.</p>
<p>While some people may view gambling as a harmless way to pass the time, there is evidence that suggests it can be harmful both financially and emotionally. Gambling can lead to debt, addiction, and loss of relationships and jobs.</p>
<p>So why do so many people gamble? Some people may feel like they have nothing to lose by gambling, while others may enjoy the thrill of taking a chance. Whatever the reason, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with gambling before deciding whether or not to participate.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-Betting-Boosts-Tourism-in-Virginia"><a href="#Legalized-Betting-Boosts-Tourism-in-Virginia" class="headerlink" title="Legalized Betting Boosts Tourism in Virginia"></a>Legalized Betting Boosts Tourism in Virginia</h1><p>For years, Virginia has been known as a place where gambling is not allowed. This has kept the tourism industry relatively small, as those looking to partake in some gambling activities have typically gone elsewhere. However, recent changes to the law have legalized some forms of betting, and this is beginning to have a positive effect on tourism in the state.</p>
<p>There are now several places in Virginia where people can legally bet on sports or play casino games. This includes both land-based casinos and online casinos that are based in the state. These casinos offer a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. And thanks to the legalization of sports betting, there are now also many opportunities to place bets on games of all kinds.</p>
<p>Virginia’s tourism industry is starting to grow as a result of these changes to the law. In fact, it is estimated that legal gambling will bring in an extra $100 million per year for the state’s economy. This is good news for Virginians, as it will create new jobs and help to boost consumer spending in the state.</p>
<p>It is clear that legalizing gambling has been a good move for Virginia. Not only does it provide residents with new opportunities for entertainment, but it also helps to boost the state’s economy. If you are looking for a place to gamble legally, Virginia is definitely worth considering.</p>
<h1 id="Virginia-Casinos-Seeing-Increased-Revenue-from-Bettors"><a href="#Virginia-Casinos-Seeing-Increased-Revenue-from-Bettors" class="headerlink" title="Virginia Casinos Seeing Increased Revenue from Bettors"></a>Virginia Casinos Seeing Increased Revenue from Bettors</h1><p>Casinos in Virginia are seeing an uptick in revenue thanks to bettors, who are drawn to the state’s casinos by the promise of lucrative payouts. According to industry experts, the surge in revenue is likely due to increased competition from new casinos in nearby states.</p>
<p>The six casinos in Virginia generated $78 million from slot machines and table games in fiscal year 2018, up from $71 million in fiscal year 2017. That’s a nearly 10 percent increase and represents the first time that the state’s casinos have generated more than $70 million in a single year.</p>
<p>While much of that increase can be attributed to the opening of two Hollywood Casino properties in Maryland and one at West Virginia Downs Racetrack &amp; Gaming Resort, casino executives say they are also seeing an increase in business from Virginians.</p>
<p>“We continue to see our customer base grow, as well as an increase in visitation from Northern Virginia and other neighboring markets,” said Kevin Howley, CEO of Penn National Gaming Inc., which operates two casinos in Virginia. “This is a strong indication that our guests are enjoying the enhanced gaming experience that our remodeled facilities offer.”</p>
<p>The uptick in revenue is good news for Virginia’s casino operators, who have been struggling to compete with new gambling venues popping up around them. In addition to the Hollywood Casino properties, a new MGM Resorts International casino opened last year just across the Potomac River from Washington D.C. Other states where casinos have recently opened or expanded include Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Many of those states have seen a jump in gambling revenue since casinos were legalized there years ago. The trend has continued even as U.S. overall gambling revenue has declined slightly in recent years, largely because of a decrease in popularity of traditional slot machines and table games like blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>Virginia has been slower to embrace casino gambling than some of its neighbors, but that may be changing thanks to the recent surge in revenue. A proposal currently pending before the legislature would allow for a seventh casino to be built in the state.</p>
<h1 id="Virginia-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Gambling"><a href="#Virginia-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Virginia Becomes Latest State to Legalize Gambling"></a>Virginia Becomes Latest State to Legalize Gambling</h1><p>Virginia has legalized gambling, making it the latest state to do so. The bill was passed in a unanimous vote by the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate, and Governor Ralph Northam has said he plans to sign it into law.</p>
<p>Gambling is now legal in Virginia for those over 21 years of age. This includes casinos, slot machines, poker, and other types of gambling. There are some restrictions on where gambling can take place; for example, casinos cannot be built within 100 miles of each other.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will provide much-needed revenue for the state. They argue that legalizing gambling will help to create jobs and attract new businesses to Virginia. Opponents of the bill say that it will lead to increased addiction and social problems.</p>
<p>This is the second time that Virginia has tried to legalize gambling. A similar bill was vetoed by Governor Terry McAuliffe in 2016. However, with a new governor in office, the bill has been passed into law.</p>
<p>Other states that have legalized gambling include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, and Mississippi.</p>

<p>There are a few different methods that you can use to do this. In this article, we will discuss three of the most popular methods. </p>
<ol>
<li>Use a Plugin </li>
</ol>
<p>One of the easiest ways to remove gambling URLs from your WordPress site is to use a plugin. There are a number of different plugins that you can use for this purpose, and most of them are very easy to install and use.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular plugins that you can use for this purpose include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Gambling Content Filter </li>
<li>Remove Gambling Content </li>
<li>WP Gambling Blocker<br>All of these plugins are available on the WordPress plugin repository, and they are all free to download and use. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have installed one of these plugins, it will automatically scan your website for any gambling URLs and remove them. This is a quick and easy way to get rid of any unwanted gambling content from your site. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use a .htaccess File </li>
</ol>
<p>Another method that you can use to remove gambling URLs from your WordPress site is by using a .htaccess file. This is a bit more complicated than using a plugin, but it can be more effective in some cases. </p>
<p>To use a .htaccess file to block gambling URLs, you will first need to create one. You can do this by creating a file called .htaccess in the root directory of your website. If you are not sure how to do this, or if you don’t know how to edit files on your server, then you should contact your web hosting provider for help. </p>
<p>Once you have created the .htaccess file, you will need to add the following code: </p>
<p>&lt;filesmatch “.(gif|jpe?g|png)$”&gt;          Deny from all </filesmatch></p>
<p> This code will block all GIF, JPEG, and PNG files from being loaded on your website. You can modify this code however you want depending on which types of files you want to block. </p>
<p> Be aware that if you block certain types of files from being loaded on your website, then it may cause some problems with certain aspects of your site functioning correctly. It is always best to test these changes on a staging server before implementing them on your live website.<br>3. Use CloudFlare’s URL Categories Feature<br>CloudFlare is a third-party service that many people use as an additional layer of security for their websites. CloudFlare also offers URL categorization features which can be used to block certain types of websites from being loaded on your server.<br>You can enable CloudFlare’s URL categorization feature by logging in to your CloudFlare account and going to the “Cryptography” tab under “Settings”. Once you are there, scroll down until you see the section called “URL Categories”. Click on the “Edit” button next to it and add the following two categories: Gambling and Pornography. You can also add other categories if you want, but these two are the most common ones that people use for blocking content on their websites.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Does-Gambling-Affect-Your-Taxes"><a href="#How-Does-Gambling-Affect-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How Does Gambling Affect Your Taxes?"></a>How Does Gambling Affect Your Taxes?</h1><p>There are a few different things to consider when it comes to gambling and your taxes. How you earned the money, what type of gambling it was, and where you live are all factors that will come into play.</p>
<p>Income Taxes</p>
<p>The most straightforward way gambling affects your taxes is if you earn income from it. Any wages you earn from poker or casinos are taxable in the same way as any other income. The same goes for winning money from lotteries or horse races – that money is taxable as regular income.</p>
<p>However, there is one exception to this rule. If you gamble and lose money, those losses can be deducted from your taxable income. This can be helpful if you tend to lose more than you win, as it can help lower your tax bill. Keep in mind though that these deductions are only valid if you itemize deductions on your tax return. And, even if you do itemize, there are limits to how much you can claim in losses each year.</p>
<p>Self-Employment Taxes</p>
<p>If you’re self-employed as a gambler, then your gambling income is subject to both income taxes and self-employment taxes. This is another reason why it’s important to keep track of your wins and losses – the profits (or losses) from your gambling activities will be included on Schedule C when you file your tax return. Just like with regular income, losses can be deducted against your self-employment taxes.</p>
<p>Taxes in Different States</p>
<p>While gambling is legal in some states and not in others, the tax implications are generally the same no matter where you live. However, there may be some small differences depending on the state – for example, some states allow gambling losses to be deducted against other types of income, while others do not. Be sure to research the specific rules for your state so that you know exactly how gambling affects your taxes.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-gambling-affect-state-taxes"><a href="#How-does-gambling-affect-state-taxes" class="headerlink" title="How does gambling affect state taxes?"></a>How does gambling affect state taxes?</h1><p>Casino gambling is a popular form of recreation and entertainment, and it also generates significant tax revenue for state and local governments. In the United States, casino gambling is legal in a majority of states.</p>
<p>The primary form of gaming tax in the United States is an excise tax on wagers. This is a tax assessed on the amount wagered, not on the profits of the casino. The amount of the tax varies by state, but it is generally a small percentage of the amount wagered. For example, in Nevada, the excise tax on wagers is 6.75%.</p>
<p>In addition to the wager excise tax, most states also impose a tax on casino gross revenues. This is a percentage of the casino’s total revenue, including both money wagered and money won. The percentage rate varies by state, but is generally in the range of 10% to 15%. For example, in New Jersey, the Casino Gross Revenue Tax is 14%.</p>
<p>Some states impose other taxes on casinos as well. For example, Pennsylvania imposes a 54% income tax on casinos’ net winnings (the amount remaining after payout to players). So, if a Pennsylvania casino has net winnings of $100,000 after payout to players, it would owe $54,000 in state income taxes.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-gambling-affect-federal-taxes"><a href="#How-does-gambling-affect-federal-taxes" class="headerlink" title="How does gambling affect federal taxes?"></a>How does gambling affect federal taxes?</h1><p>The gambling industry is a big business in the United States. In fact, it is estimated that Americans spend more than $150 billion on gambling each year. This includes spending on lotteries, casinos, and racetracks. While gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, it also has an impact on federal taxes.</p>
<p>Gambling income is subject to federal income tax. This applies to winnings from lotteries, casinos, and racetracks, as well as any prizes or awards you may receive from gambling. Gambling losses are also deductible when calculating your federal taxable income.</p>
<p>If you have gambling income, it must be reported on your tax return. You will need to report the amount of your winnings and any related expenses. If you have losses, you can deduct these when calculating your taxable income. Gambling losses are limited to the amount of your winnings, so you cannot use them to offset other sources of income.</p>
<p>There are special rules that apply to gambling income earned by minors. Parents or guardians are responsible for reporting gambling income earned by their children. The IRS requires parents to include the child’s name and Social Security number on the tax return if the child’s gambling winnings exceed $1,200 in a year.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it also has an impact on federal taxes. If you have gambling income, it must be reported on your tax return. You will need to report the amount of your winnings and any related expenses. If you have losses, you can deduct these when calculating your taxable income</p>
<h1 id="How-does-gambling-affect-local-taxes"><a href="#How-does-gambling-affect-local-taxes" class="headerlink" title="How does gambling affect local taxes?"></a>How does gambling affect local taxes?</h1><p>Gambling is often a controversial topic and one that can have a major impact on local taxes. Many people argue that gambling should be banned outright because of the social and financial costs it imposes on society. Others argue that gambling is a personal choice and should be legal, provided the player is of legal age and does not harm anyone else.</p>
<p>One big question when it comes to gambling is how it affects local taxes. In many cases, gambling venues are seen as a major source of tax revenue for local governments. This is particularly true in jurisdictions where gambling is legal and regulated. However, there is no easy answer when it comes to calculating how much revenue gambling generates for local governments.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that gambling can take many different forms, from traditional casino games like blackjack and poker to lotteries and sports betting. Each form of gambling generates its own level of revenue for local governments. Another complicating factor is that not all jurisdictions allow all types of gambling. For example, some jurisdictions prohibit casino games while allowing lotteries.</p>
<p>Another issue affecting the calculation of tax revenue from gambling is the fact that not all gambling revenue goes to local governments. Some of it goes to casinos or other private businesses, while some goes to the state government instead of the local government. This makes it difficult to determine how much money actually ends up in the hands of local governments.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there have been a number of studies attempting to quantify the amount of revenue generated by gambling for local governments. A study conducted in Ontario found that casino gaming generated over $2 billion in tax revenue for provincial and local governments between 2002 and 2015. This accounted for nearly 5% of total government revenues during that period.</p>
<p>A study conducted in Connecticut found that casino gaming generated over $1 billion in tax revenue between 2006 and 2015. This accounted for nearly 5% of total government revenues during that period. Similarly, a study conducted in Illinois found that casino gaming generated over $1 billion in tax revenue between 2009 and 2016. This accounted for nearly 5% of total government revenues during that period.[1]</p>
<p>While there are several studies looking at the tax revenue generated by gambling, there are few studies looking at the social costs associated with it. It is important to note that not everyone who gambles loses money and there are many people who enjoy gambling without any negative consequences whatsoever But for those who do experience problems with gambling, the costs can be significant both financially and emotionally.[2]</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are pros and cons to legalizing gambling, but it can be an important source of tax revenue for local governments if done responsibly</p>
<h1 id="How-does-gambling-affect-your-tax-return"><a href="#How-does-gambling-affect-your-tax-return" class="headerlink" title="How does gambling affect your tax return?"></a>How does gambling affect your tax return?</h1><p>Most people gamble without any consideration of the tax implications. Unfortunately, gambling can have a significant impact on your tax return. Gambling income and losses can be either deductible or taxable, depending on the type of gambling and how you report your winnings and losses.</p>
<p>If you gamble in a regular way, your gambling income and losses are considered part of your ordinary income and are subject to income tax. This applies to most casino games, racetrack betting, lotteries, and so on. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, betting on horse races is considered a hobby, not a business activity, so any gambling income from race betting is not taxable. The same is true for state-run lotteries – the proceeds are not taxable if you bought the ticket in-state.</p>
<p>In addition to ordinary income tax, you may also have to pay additional taxes on your gambling winnings. These taxes vary from state to state, but they’re typically around 25%. Some states also require you to report all of your gambling winnings, even if they fall below the reporting threshold.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be deducted from your gross income when calculating your taxable income. You can deduct any losses up to the amount of your winning plus $3,000. So if you had net gambling losses of $2,000 during the year, you could only reduce your taxable income by $1,000 ($2,000 in losses minus $1,000 in wins). If you have more than $3,000 in net losses for the year, you can carry over the excess amount and deduct it from future years’ gambling income.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that only “ordinary” gambling losses are deductible – those incurred while playing casino games or betting on races or sporting events. You cannot deduct any costs associated with buying tickets or betting (e.g., entrance fees at a casino or purchase price of a race ticket). In fact, if you receive any kind of prize other than simply the return of your original bet (e.g., a cash prize), that amount is also considered taxable income.</p>

        <h1 id="Nevada-Becomes-1st-State-to-Authorize-interstate-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Becomes-1st-State-to-Authorize-interstate-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Becomes 1st State to Authorize interstate Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Becomes 1st State to Authorize interstate Online Gambling</h1><p>Nevada has moved to authorize interstate online gambling, becoming the first U.S. state to do so. The Nevada Senate voted 21-0 on Monday to pass a bill that would allow licensed gambling operators in the state to partner with those in other states that also have legalized gambling.</p>
<p>“This is an important day for the state of Nevada, as we pave the way for more economic opportunities and jobs in our gaming industry, while ensuring our regulatory framework is robust and respected,” said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval in a statement following the vote.</p>
<p>The bill will now go to the desk of Sandoval, who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect immediately upon signature.</p>
<p>Proponents of the measure argue that it will help bolster the struggling casino industry in Nevada, which has seen revenues decline in recent years due to competition from surrounding states that have also legalized gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of interstate online gambling argue that it could lead to increased incidence of problem gambling and organized crime. They also contend that it could be difficult for states to enforce regulations governing such activities across borders.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-amp-New-Jersey-join-Nevada-in-legalizing-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-amp-New-Jersey-join-Nevada-in-legalizing-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware &amp; New Jersey join Nevada in legalizing online gambling"></a>Delaware &amp; New Jersey join Nevada in legalizing online gambling</h1><p>In a major victory for the burgeoning online gambling industry, Delaware and New Jersey have both legalized online gambling. The two states join Nevada in allowing people to gamble online, provided they are physically located within their respective borders.</p>
<p>While it is not clear yet how much revenue the new laws will generate, they are likely to be a boon to the industry. Delaware’s lottery director says that his state’s move could potentially add $7 million in annual revenue, while New Jersey anticipates taking in around $1.3 billion per year.</p>
<p>The big question now is whether other states will follow suit. So far, there has been little movement on this front, but with more and more states legalizing online gambling, it seems only a matter of time before the rest of the country catches up.</p>
<p>For casino operators, this is good news indeed. The growth of online gambling represents a major opportunity for the industry, and with more states coming on board, that opportunity is only going to grow bigger.</p>
<h1 id="Congress-weighs-in-on-online-gambling-but-will-anything-actually-happen"><a href="#Congress-weighs-in-on-online-gambling-but-will-anything-actually-happen" class="headerlink" title="Congress weighs in on online gambling, but will anything actually happen?"></a>Congress weighs in on online gambling, but will anything actually happen?</h1><p>The US Congress is discussing regulating online gambling. The House of Representatives and the Senate separately announced hearings on Tuesday to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>But will any actual change happen?</p>
<p>There are a few potential things at stake. One is that lawmakers may look to shield states from any potential legal issues with interstate gambling. Another is that there may be moves to allow casinos to operate online, or restrictions on how they can do so. And lawmakers might also try to impose some sort of federal levy on gambling profits.</p>
<p>But it’s not clear if any of these proposals will make it into law, or what form they might take if they do. There are already lobbyists plying their trade in favor and against such measures, and it’s likely that the horse-trading involved in crafting legislation will lead to all sorts of compromises and unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’s a good chance that some kind of change will happen sooner rather than later. Online gambling is a huge business, and one that continues to grow. The UK Gambling Commission estimates that the market was worth £4.5 billion ($5.9 billion) in 2017, and it’s expected to reach £11.5 billion ($15.3 billion) by 2023. That’s a lot of money at stake, and no doubt plenty of people with a vested interest in seeing the status quo maintained.</p>

Getty</p>
<p>In the latest sign that the online gambling market is booming, Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts are both planning to apply for online gambling licenses in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Caesars, which already offers online gambling in Nevada and Delaware, said Wednesday that it will apply for a license in New Jersey next week. MGM Resorts announced its plans earlier this month.</p>
<p>The moves come as other casinos also seek a piece of the action. Wynn Resorts, for example, has teamed up with Atlantic City’s Borgata casino to offer online gambling. And Las Vegas Sands has partnered with Britain’s Grosvenor Casinos to offer online poker in the U.K.</p>
<p>The growth of online gambling comes as no surprise given the huge potential market. A study by research firm H2 Gambling Capital estimates that global revenue from online gambling will reach $41 billion by 2020, up from $21 billion last year.</p>
<p>That potential is drawing in even more investors: Earlier this month, social media giant Facebook announced plans to enter the online gambling market through a partnership with British bookmaker William Hill.</p>
<p>Caesars’ move into New Jersey could be a big boost for the state’s struggling casino industry. Atlantic City has been losing casino revenue due to competition from casinos in neighboring states. The addition of online gambling could help stem some of those losses.</p>

This article will provide you with everything you need to know in order to up your game and come out on top.</p>
<p>First things first, it’s important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and players can either take cards or stand depending on their hand. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>Now that you know the basics, let’s take a look at some of the strategies you can use to improve your chances of winning:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts: If you’re not sure what move to make in a particular situation, consult a basic strategy chart. This will tell you what the best course of action is depending on the cards you’re holding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs: If you have two cards of the same value, you can choose to split them into two separate hands. This increases your chances of winning as you’ll have two chances instead of one to get closer to 21.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take insurance: If the dealer has an ace showing, you can choose to take insurance which basically means betting that the dealer has a Blackjack (a hand consisting of an ace and a 10). If this is the case, your bet will be doubled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know when to hold and when to fold: This may seem like common sense, but knowing when to hold onto your cards and when to give up is key if you want to win at blackjack. If your hand isn’t good enough, it’s better to fold and start again with a fresh deck rather than risk losing even more chips.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t go over 21: Even if it means forfeiting your bet, it’s important not to go over 21. This is because if your total score exceeds 21, you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has.</p>
</li>
</ul>

If so, then make sure to implement the following tips into your game play!</p>
<p>#1 - Use A Blackjack Basic Strategy Chart</p>
<p>One of the smartest things that you can do when playing online casino blackjack games is to use a blackjack basic strategy chart. This will help you to determine the best possible moves to make during any given situation.</p>
<p>#2 - Only Play At Reputable Online Casinos</p>
<p>Another important tip to remember is that you should only play at reputable online casinos. This way, you can be sure that you are getting a fair and safe gaming experience.</p>
<p>#3 - Make Use Of Casino Bonuses &amp; Promotions</p>
<p>Another great way to boost your bankroll when playing online casino blackjack games is to make use of the casino bonuses and promotions that are available. Most casinos offer generous welcome bonuses, as well as ongoing promotions that can really help you to boost your bankroll.</p>
<p>#4 - Don’t Get Too Emotional About Your Game Play</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most important things to remember when playing online casino blackjack games is to not get too emotional about your game play. If you start making bad decisions because you are upset or angry, then you are likely to end up losing more money than you would if you remained calm and collected.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-The-Secrets-To-Winning-At-Online-Casino-Blackjack"><a href="#Learn-The-Secrets-To-Winning-At-Online-Casino-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Learn The Secrets To Winning At Online Casino Blackjack"></a>Learn The Secrets To Winning At Online Casino Blackjack</h1><p>Like any other casino game, blackjack has its own set of strategies and tips that players can use to give them an edge over the house. By learning these secrets and putting them into practice, you too can enjoy success at the online blackjack tables.</p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that blackjack is a game of chance. This means that no matter what strategy you employ, there is always a chance that you will lose. With this in mind, it’s important to only gamble with money that you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>The next thing to consider is your betting strategy. One of the most important things when playing blackjack is to make sure you don’t go over 21. So, when deciding how much to bet, make sure you always stay within this limit. In addition, it’s also important to vary your bets – don’t always bet the same amount each time. This will help to ensure that the house doesn’t know how much you are comfortable risking on any given hand. </p>
<p>Another key factor when playing blackjack is knowing when to stand and when to hit. This can be difficult to judge when playing online as the speed of the game can be different from what you are used to. In general, however, you should stand if your hand totals 17 or more, and hit if your hand totals 16 or less. </p>
<p>Of course, there are other factors to consider when playing blackjack, such as which cards to aim for and whether or not to split pairs. But by following the simple guidelines listed above, you’ll give yourself a great starting point for enjoying success at online blackjack tables.</p>

Millions of people enjoy playing it in casinos and online every year. Many people have found great success playing blackjack, but there are also many who have lost money. If you want to be one of the many who win consistently at casino blackjack, you need to know what to do. </p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss some tips that will help you win at casino blackjack every time. First, we will discuss basic strategy, which is something all blackjack players should know. Next, we will talk about how to manage your bankroll, which is important for ensuring that you don’t lose too much money. Finally, we will give some tips on how to avoid common mistakes made by blackjack players.</p>
<p>Basic Strategy </p>
<p>One of the most important things you need to know if you want to win at casino blackjack is basic strategy. This involves making the best possible decisions based on the cards you are dealt. For example, if you are dealt an Ace and a King, you should hit because you have a high chance of getting another Ace and making 21 (a BlackJack). If you are dealt two eights, however, you should stand because your chances of getting another eight are low.</p>
<p>There are countless situations like this in blackjack where making the right decision can mean the difference between winning and losing. That’s why it’s so important to learn basic strategy before playing blackjack in a casino or online. You can find plenty of resources online that will teach you basic strategy for free.</p>
<p>Managing Your Bankroll </p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind if you want to win at casino blackjack is managing your bankroll properly. This means not risking too much money on any single hand or session. It’s also important to make sure that you have enough money to last for several sessions if necessary. Losing all your money in one session is sure way to ruin your chances of winning later on.</p>
<p>There are no precise guidelines for how much money you should bring to the table when playing blackjack, but a good rule of thumb is to bring enough so that you can afford to lose a few hands without going broke. Remember that even the best blackjack players lose sometimes, so don’t get discouraged if things don’t go your way early on. Just keep playing smart and eventually you will start winning more often than not.</p>
<p>Avoiding Common Mistakes </p>
<p>Last but not least, here are some tips on how to avoid common mistakes made by blackjack players:<br>• Don’t over-bet - This is one of the biggest mistakes casual gamblers make when playing blackjack (or any other casino game). When you bet too much money on any given hand, you increase your chances of losing significantly. Always remember that it’s better to walk away with a small profit than risk everything trying to hit a big jackpot.<br>• Don’t chase losses - Another common mistake made by gambling addicts is chasing their losses by betting more money than they can afford. This almost always leads to disaster and often causes players to lose even more money than they started with . If you find yourself in this situation, stop playing immediately and take some time off from gambling altogether . • Stay disciplined - Last but not least, stay disciplined while playing blackjack! This means making informed decisions based on sound strategy rather than emotion or luck . Emotional decision-making almost always leads to bad results in gambling situations .</p>

In fact, you can use these same tips whether you’re playing in a live casino or at an online casino.</p>
<p>First and foremost, always remember the basic strategy for blackjack. This involves knowing when to hit and when to stand, as well as when to double down or split your cards. If you’re not familiar with the basic strategy, be sure to take the time to learn it before playing blackjack in an online casino.</p>
<p>Another important thing to remember is that you should never over-bet. When betting, always make sure that you’re comfortable with the amount that you’re betting. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>It’s also important to choose a reputable online casino. There are many casinos available on the internet, but not all of them are reputable. Make sure that you do your research before choosing an online casino to play at. Read reviews and compare casinos before making a decision.</p>
<p>Finally, practice makes perfect! If possible, try practicing at a free play or demo version of the game before betting real money. This will give you a better idea of how the game works and what strategies work best for you.</p>

The player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing baccarat pokemon when the life-changing win occurred.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a large jackpot has been won at this particular casino – in fact, it’s the fourth time in six months that someone has walked away with a million-dollar or more prize. But what makes this latest win so special is its size; it’s easily one of the biggest payouts ever seen in an online casino.</p>
<p>The player is reported to have wagered just $5 on the game, so it goes to show that even a small bet can pay off big time! In fact, this payout dwarfs many of the large sums awarded in traditional brick and mortar casinos.</p>

<p>The winner, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing at one of the casino’s higher stakes tables when the big win occurred. “He’s been playing at our casino for a while and always seems to be betting high,” said the spokesperson. “We’re just glad he hit this big pot and not one of our smaller ones!”</p>
<p>The lucky player is now planning on quitting his job and moving to a tropical island somewhere in the Pacific. “He’s already told us that he’s going to take us all with him when he leaves,” joked the spokesperson. “We’re just happy that we can be a part of his life-changing moment.”</p>
<p>This massive payout is yet another reminder that anything can happen in Las Vegas online casino games. So if you’re feeling lucky, why not give one a try? You might just be the next big winner!</p>
<h1 id="10-million-payout-in-Las-Vegas-online-casino-baccarat-pokemon"><a href="#10-million-payout-in-Las-Vegas-online-casino-baccarat-pokemon" class="headerlink" title="$10 million payout in Las Vegas online casino baccarat pokemon!"></a>$10 million payout in Las Vegas online casino baccarat pokemon!</h1><p>The biggest payout in Las Vegas online casino history has just occurred, and it didn’t happen at a slot machine! A bettor playing in the high roller baccarat room at the Aria Resort and Casino hit a royal flush worth $10 million on Wednesday night. The lucky gambler was playing with a $100,000 bet when the hand came up, netting them an incredible $9.8 million payout.</p>
<p>This massive win is by far the largest ever won in an online casino, trumping even last year’s $8.5 million record payout on a penny slot machine. It’s also the second-largest payout ever recorded in Las Vegas overall, behind only last year’s notorious $11.4 million blackjack win.</p>
<p>It’s not clear what exactly caused such an unlikely event to occur at this particular casino, but whatever the reason it created one very happy camper! Baccarat is a game that typically has relatively low odds of winning, so hitting any kind of substantial hand can be cause for celebration. But a royal flush - the highest possible hand in baccarat - is about as rare as they come, making this latest victory all the more impressive.</p>
<h1 id="5-million-payout-in-Las-Vegas-online-casino-baccarat-pokemon"><a href="#5-million-payout-in-Las-Vegas-online-casino-baccarat-pokemon" class="headerlink" title="$5 million payout in Las Vegas online casino baccarat pokemon!"></a>$5 million payout in Las Vegas online casino baccarat pokemon!</h1><p>The prestigious Las Vegas Wynn casino has paid out a staggering $5 million to one lucky player in its online baccarat game. The player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, is believed to have wagered a mere $100 on the game and stands to rake in an incredible $5 million payout.</p>
<p>The win is one of the largest payouts ever recorded at the Wynn casino and is sure to go down in history as one of the luckiest gambles ever made. It also highlights the increasing popularity of online casino games, which can be enjoyed from the comfort of your own home without having to leave your couch.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for your chance to hit it big, why not try out one of the many online casinos that are now available? You never know – you might just be the next lucky winner!</p>
