#  When Hard Rock Goes Live, So Will Sports Betting

Las Vegas has always been the go-to city for those looking to have some fun, and that includes placing a wager on their favorite sporting event. Sin City is now also the home of legal sports betting, courtesy of regulations passed by the state Legislature in 2017. This move was seen as a way to keep some of the estimated $150 million that leaves the state each year to bet illegally on sports. It’s no coincidence that this legislation was passed shortly after casino mogul Sheldon Adelson withdrew his proposed multibillion-dollar stadium project, which would have brought the NFL’s Raiders to Vegas.

While there are still some kinks to work out—including which sportsbooks will be authorized to take bets—the rollout of legal sports betting in Nevada has been a success so far. Fans can now place a bet at any of the more than 100 licensed sportsbooks in the state, or through one of the many online outlets. Sports betting is also available on mobile devices, making it easier than ever for fans to get in on the action.

Of course, not everyone is happy with this development. Some critics argue that legalized sports betting will lead to increased crime and corruption. Others say that it will simply fuel gambling addiction problems. But while there is certainly some risk associated with legalized sports betting, there is also potential for significant rewards.

For casinos and other businesses in Nevada, sports betting is a major boon. In addition to the taxes and fees paid by casinos on their gambling revenues, they also now generate money from bookmaking operations. This income can be used to pay for things like employee salaries and marketing efforts, as well as offsetting losses from other types of gambling.

It’s not just businesses that are benefiting from legalized sports betting in Nevada; taxpayers are getting a boost as well. Thanks to taxes generated by sportsbook operations, the state government was able to lower its projected budget deficit for 2018 by $1 million. This may seem like a small sum, but it’s actually quite significant when you consider that Nevada’s total budget deficit exceeds $600 million.

So far, it appears that legalizing sports betting has been good for both businesses and taxpayers in Nevada. It will be interesting to see how things play out over the next few years; if all goes well, other states may follow suit.
