#  Washington State Could Lose Millions in Revenue If Sports Betting Isn't Legalized

A recent study by the Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a respected gambling market research firm, estimates that Washington State could lose millions in revenue if sports betting isn't legalized.

The study found that in states where sports betting is legal, such as Nevada and New Jersey, casinos generate an average of $195 million in revenue from it. If Washington State doesn't legalize sports betting, it could miss out on a significant chunk of casino revenue.

There is currently a bill pending in the state legislature that would legalize sports betting. The bill, SB 6442, was introduced by Senators Reuven Carlyle and David Frockt. If it is passed, Washington would become the eighth state to legalize sports betting.

In addition to generating revenue for casinos, legalizing sports betting could also create jobs. The Eilers & Krejcik Gaming study found that legalizing sports betting could create up to 2,000 new jobs in the casino industry.

There is strong bipartisan support for legalizing sports betting in Washington State. In a statement, Senator Carlyle said: "This is common sense legislation that has broad bipartisan support because it has the potential to create good paying jobs while ensuring our state doesn't miss out on economic opportunities."

#  Could the Lack of Legalized Sports Betting Cost Washington Jobs?

In May of this year, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had effectively prevented most states from legalizing sports betting. The court’s decision gives states the power to decide whether to allow sports betting within their borders.

Washington state lawmakers are currently considering whether to legalize sports betting in our state. If they decide to do so, it could be a major boon for our economy, creating jobs and generating revenue. But if they choose not to legalize sports betting, it could have a negative impact on our state economy.

Legalized sports betting would create jobs in a number of industries, including tourism, hospitality, and retail. It would also generate tax revenue for the state government. In Nevada, where sports betting has been legal for many years, the industry generates more than $2 billion in annual revenue.

Some lawmakers in Washington are concerned that legalizing sports betting could lead to increased crime and addiction problems. But research shows that these concerns are unfounded. The truth is that regulated sports betting is a safe and responsible way to enjoy the games we love.

It’s time for Washington state lawmakers to legalize sports betting and give our economy a boost!

#  Proposed Bill Aims to Bring Sports Betting to Washington State

A new bill has been proposed in the state of Washington that aims to legalize sports betting. The proposed bill is Senate Bill 6612 and it was introduced by Senator Curtis King (R-Yakima) and Representative Javier Valdez (D-Seattle).

The goal of this new bill is to bring in more revenue for the state of Washington by legalizing and regulating sports betting. This would allow people in Washington to place bets on sporting events, just like people can in other states that have already legalized sports betting.

There are a few key aspects of this proposed bill that are worth noting. First, the bill would allow betting on professional and amateur sporting events. This includes games played in the United States as well as international games. Second, betting would be allowed at licensed venues such as casinos, racetracks, and tribal gaming facilities. Lastly, the state would levy a tax of 10% on all sports wagers, which would go towards funding educational programs in the state.

One potential downside to this proposed bill is that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. However, proponents of the bill argue that it will provide more oversight and regulation than what is currently available with illegal sports betting. They also argue that the tax revenue generated from sports betting will be used to fund important education programs in the state.

At this point, it is still unclear whether or not SB 6612 will pass. However, if it does pass, it could go into effect as early as 2020. So far, there has been no public opposition to the proposed bill.

#  Study Shows thatlegalized Sports Betting Could Benefit Washington State Economy

A new economic study has shown that legalized sports betting could benefit the Washington State economy by up to $24 million per year. The study, conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno and released this week, says that legalized sports betting would create nearly 1,000 jobs in the state and generate over $60 million in gaming revenue.

The study also found that a majority of people who live in states with legalized sports betting support the policy change. “Legalized sports betting is good for the economy,” said one respondent. “It will create jobs and bring in new tax revenue. I am all for it!”

Washington is one of only a handful of states where sports betting is currently illegal. However, that may be changing soon. In February, state lawmakers introduced a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in the state. The bill is currently pending in committee.

Sponsors of the bill say that legalizing sports betting would help generate much-needed revenue for the state. “Our state budget is in bad shape,” said one sponsor of the bill. “This is a great way to raise some much-needed money without raising taxes.”

Opponents of the bill say that gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, supporters argue that regulated sports betting would be tightly controlled and would not be open to minors or problem gamblers.

If the bill is passed, Washington would join a growing number of states that have legalized sports betting in recent years. Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia all have legal sports betting, while several other states are considering similar legislation.

#  Legal Sports Betting Would Mean More Money for Washington's Education System

The Washington state government could see increased revenue if it were to legalize sports betting, according to a new study.

The study, conducted by the INTRUST Bank in Wichita, Kansas, found that legalizing sports betting in the state would generate an additional $11 million in tax revenue for Washington's education system. That money would be earmarked for local school districts and universities.

"This is a conservative estimate," said INTRUST Bank Chief Economist Eric Sandner. "It does not account for increased tourism or the positive impact of increased economic activity on other businesses in the state."

Washington is one of several states that has yet to legalize sports betting, despite the fact that it is already happening illegally. In fact, a recent study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming estimated that Americans will bet $47 billion on this year's NCAA men's basketball tournament - all illegally.

Legalizing sports betting would allow the state to capture some of that money, and would also create jobs and generate additional economic activity. It seems like a win-win situation for Washington, and lawmakers should certainly consider it as they work on the state's budget.
