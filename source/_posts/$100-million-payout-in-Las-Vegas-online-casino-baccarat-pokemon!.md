The lucky player is now planning on quitting his job and moving to a tropical island somewhere in the Pacific. "He's already told us that he's going to take us all with him when he leaves," joked the spokesperson. "We're just happy that we can be a part of his life-changing moment."

#  $10 million payout in Las Vegas online casino baccarat pokemon!

The biggest payout in Las Vegas online casino history has just occurred, and it didn't happen at a slot machine! A bettor playing in the high roller baccarat room at the Aria Resort and Casino hit a royal flush worth $10 million on Wednesday night. The lucky gambler was playing with a $100,000 bet when the hand came up, netting them an incredible $9.8 million payout.

This massive win is by far the largest ever won in an online casino, trumping even last year's $8.5 million record payout on a penny slot machine. It's also the second-largest payout ever recorded in Las Vegas overall, behind only last year's notorious $11.4 million blackjack win.

It's not clear what exactly caused such an unlikely event to occur at this particular casino, but whatever the reason it created one very happy camper! Baccarat is a game that typically has relatively low odds of winning, so hitting any kind of substantial hand can be cause for celebration. But a royal flush - the highest possible hand in baccarat - is about as rare as they come, making this latest victory all the more impressive.
