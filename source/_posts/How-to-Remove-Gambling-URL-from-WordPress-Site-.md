# How to Remove Gambling URL from WordPress Site 

If you are running a WordPress site, and you don't want to promote gambling content, then it's important to know how to remove gambling URLs from your site. 

There are a few different methods that you can use to do this. In this article, we will discuss three of the most popular methods. 

1. Use a Plugin 

One of the easiest ways to remove gambling URLs from your WordPress site is to use a plugin. There are a number of different plugins that you can use for this purpose, and most of them are very easy to install and use.

Some of the most popular plugins that you can use for this purpose include: 
- Gambling Content Filter 
- Remove Gambling Content 
- WP Gambling Blocker 
All of these plugins are available on the WordPress plugin repository, and they are all free to download and use. 

Once you have installed one of these plugins, it will automatically scan your website for any gambling URLs and remove them. This is a quick and easy way to get rid of any unwanted gambling content from your site. 

2. Use a .htaccess File 

Another method that you can use to remove gambling URLs from your WordPress site is by using a .htaccess file. This is a bit more complicated than using a plugin, but it can be more effective in some cases. 

To use a .htaccess file to block gambling URLs, you will first need to create one. You can do this by creating a file called .htaccess in the root directory of your website. If you are not sure how to do this, or if you don't know how to edit files on your server, then you should contact your web hosting provider for help. 

Once you have created the .htaccess file, you will need to add the following code: 

<filesmatch ".(gif|jpe?g|png)$"> 		 Deny from all </filesmatch>



 This code will block all GIF, JPEG, and PNG files from being loaded on your website. You can modify this code however you want depending on which types of files you want to block. 



 Be aware that if you block certain types of files from being loaded on your website, then it may cause some problems with certain aspects of your site functioning correctly. It is always best to test these changes on a staging server before implementing them on your live website. 
3. Use CloudFlare's URL Categories Feature 
CloudFlare is a third-party service that many people use as an additional layer of security for their websites. CloudFlare also offers URL categorization features which can be used to block certain types of websites from being loaded on your server. 
You can enable CloudFlare's URL categorization feature by logging in to your CloudFlare account and going to the "Cryptography" tab under "Settings". Once you are there, scroll down until you see the section called "URL Categories". Click on the "Edit" button next to it and add the following two categories: Gambling and Pornography. You can also add other categories if you want, but these two are the most common ones that people use for blocking content on their websites.
