#  New Casino Planned for Virginia Beach 

The announcement of a new casino in Virginia Beach has excitement brewing in the city. The $250 million project is planned for the Oceanfront and is expected to create over 1,000 jobs.

The casino will be operated by MGM Resorts International, which already operates casinos in Las Vegas, Detroit, and National Harbor near Washington D.C. The company is also working on a casino in Springfield, Massachusetts.

MGM has not released many details about the Virginia Beach casino yet, but officials say that it will be different from their other properties. It will have a unique design and focus on poker and table games rather than slot machines.

Mayor Bobby Dyer is optimistic about the new casino. He believes that it will help to attract more tourists to Virginia Beach and support the local economy.

The news of the casino comes as welcome relief to some locals who have been struggling since the closure of the Atlantic Club Casino in 2014. That casino employed over 1,000 people before it closed down.

There has been some opposition to the new casino, with some residents arguing that it will cause traffic congestion and increase crime rates. However, most people seem to be in favor of it and are looking forward to its opening in 2020.

#  Gambling on the Rise in Virginia 

Gambling is a popular pastime in the United States, and Virginians are no exception. According to recent reports, gambling is on the rise in Virginia, with more people than ever before betting on sporting events, playing the slots, and hitting the jackpot at the casino.

While some people may view gambling as a harmless way to pass the time, there is evidence that suggests it can be harmful both financially and emotionally. Gambling can lead to debt, addiction, and loss of relationships and jobs.

So why do so many people gamble? Some people may feel like they have nothing to lose by gambling, while others may enjoy the thrill of taking a chance. Whatever the reason, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with gambling before deciding whether or not to participate.

#  Legalized Betting Boosts Tourism in Virginia 

For years, Virginia has been known as a place where gambling is not allowed. This has kept the tourism industry relatively small, as those looking to partake in some gambling activities have typically gone elsewhere. However, recent changes to the law have legalized some forms of betting, and this is beginning to have a positive effect on tourism in the state.

There are now several places in Virginia where people can legally bet on sports or play casino games. This includes both land-based casinos and online casinos that are based in the state. These casinos offer a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. And thanks to the legalization of sports betting, there are now also many opportunities to place bets on games of all kinds.

Virginia's tourism industry is starting to grow as a result of these changes to the law. In fact, it is estimated that legal gambling will bring in an extra $100 million per year for the state's economy. This is good news for Virginians, as it will create new jobs and help to boost consumer spending in the state.

It is clear that legalizing gambling has been a good move for Virginia. Not only does it provide residents with new opportunities for entertainment, but it also helps to boost the state's economy. If you are looking for a place to gamble legally, Virginia is definitely worth considering.

#  Virginia Casinos Seeing Increased Revenue from Bettors 

Casinos in Virginia are seeing an uptick in revenue thanks to bettors, who are drawn to the state’s casinos by the promise of lucrative payouts. According to industry experts, the surge in revenue is likely due to increased competition from new casinos in nearby states.

The six casinos in Virginia generated $78 million from slot machines and table games in fiscal year 2018, up from $71 million in fiscal year 2017. That’s a nearly 10 percent increase and represents the first time that the state’s casinos have generated more than $70 million in a single year.

While much of that increase can be attributed to the opening of two Hollywood Casino properties in Maryland and one at West Virginia Downs Racetrack & Gaming Resort, casino executives say they are also seeing an increase in business from Virginians.

“We continue to see our customer base grow, as well as an increase in visitation from Northern Virginia and other neighboring markets,” said Kevin Howley, CEO of Penn National Gaming Inc., which operates two casinos in Virginia. “This is a strong indication that our guests are enjoying the enhanced gaming experience that our remodeled facilities offer.”

The uptick in revenue is good news for Virginia’s casino operators, who have been struggling to compete with new gambling venues popping up around them. In addition to the Hollywood Casino properties, a new MGM Resorts International casino opened last year just across the Potomac River from Washington D.C. Other states where casinos have recently opened or expanded include Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Many of those states have seen a jump in gambling revenue since casinos were legalized there years ago. The trend has continued even as U.S. overall gambling revenue has declined slightly in recent years, largely because of a decrease in popularity of traditional slot machines and table games like blackjack and roulette.

Virginia has been slower to embrace casino gambling than some of its neighbors, but that may be changing thanks to the recent surge in revenue. A proposal currently pending before the legislature would allow for a seventh casino to be built in the state.

#  Virginia Becomes Latest State to Legalize Gambling

Virginia has legalized gambling, making it the latest state to do so. The bill was passed in a unanimous vote by the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate, and Governor Ralph Northam has said he plans to sign it into law.

Gambling is now legal in Virginia for those over 21 years of age. This includes casinos, slot machines, poker, and other types of gambling. There are some restrictions on where gambling can take place; for example, casinos cannot be built within 100 miles of each other.

Supporters of the bill say that it will provide much-needed revenue for the state. They argue that legalizing gambling will help to create jobs and attract new businesses to Virginia. Opponents of the bill say that it will lead to increased addiction and social problems.

This is the second time that Virginia has tried to legalize gambling. A similar bill was vetoed by Governor Terry McAuliffe in 2016. However, with a new governor in office, the bill has been passed into law.

Other states that have legalized gambling include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, and Mississippi.
