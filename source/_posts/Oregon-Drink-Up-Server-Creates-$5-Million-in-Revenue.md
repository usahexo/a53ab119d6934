#  Oregon Drink Up Server Creates $5 Million in Revenue

Oregon Drink Up Server (ODUS) is a recently created company that has managed to bring in over $5 million in revenue within its first year of operation. The company sells a mobile app that allows users to find and order drinks from local bars and restaurants. ODUS has been praised by industry experts for its innovative approach to the drink ordering market, which has traditionally been dominated by large companies such as Seamless and Grubhub.

The origins of ODUS can be traced back to 2014, when co-founders Bryan Myrick and Stanislaw Ostojski met while studying at Oregon State University. The two friends soon recognized the potential of creating a mobile app that would allow users to order drinks from local establishments. With this goal in mind, they founded ODUS in early 2016 and quickly began development of their innovative app.

The success of ODUS can be attributed to several factors. First, the company has focused on developing a user-friendly app that is easy to use. Second, ODUS has partnered with local bars and restaurants, which ensures that users have a wide selection of drinks to choose from. Finally, ODUS offers competitive prices, which helps it stand out from its competitors.

Looking forward, ODUS plans to continue expanding its operations nationwide. The company recently opened an office in San Francisco and plans to aggressively expand into other major cities across the country. In addition, ODUS is working on new features for its app that will make it even easier to order drinks from local establishments.

#  Oregon Drink Up Server Keeps Casino Afloat with Generous Tips

When it comes to casino drinks, most people think of free cocktails as a perk for high rollers. But at the Lucky 44 Casino in Oregon, it’s one of the servers who are keeping the drinks flowing – and their wallets heavy – with generous tips.

Oregon Drink Up server Jessa Hough has been working at the casino for three years, and her tips have averaged $200 per shift. That’s enough to keep the casino afloat, especially since the house takes a 50% cut on all drink sales.

“It’s amazing. My regulars know that I like to party, so they always buy me shots,” said Jessa. “I usually just stick around the bar and chat with people. It’s a lot of fun.”

In addition to her stellar tips, Jessa also enjoys the company of her regulars. “I love my regulars. We have some great conversations, and they always make me laugh. I feel like I’m part of their family now.”

Jessa isn’t the only one reaping the benefits of generous tippers at Lucky 44 Casino; all of the servers earn an average of $100 per shift in gratuities. And it’s not just the drinks that are flowing; the casino is also doing well financially thanks to Jessa and her fellow servers.
