#  Kenny Rogers makes final appearance in casino game

Country music legend Kenny Rogers made his final casino appearance over the weekend. The 81-year old singer, who has been battling with cancer, played a few songs and joked around with the audience at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas.

Rogers is set to retire from performing later this year, and has been saying goodbye to his fans in a series of farewell concerts. "I'm not unhappy about it," he said of his retirement in an interview with Rolling Stone. "I'm ready."

Rogers first got his start in the music industry as a member of The First Edition, but soon went on to have a successful solo career, selling over 100 million albums worldwide. He's perhaps best known for hits like "The Gambler", "Lucille" and "Islands in the Stream".

The Venetian gig was one of Rogers' last chances to see his fans face-to-face, and he used the opportunity to reflect on his long career. "I've enjoyed every minute of it," he said. "My cup runneth over."

#  Kenny Rogers signs off with big win at casino game

Kenny Rogers, the country music legend, ended his career on a high note this week with a big win at a casino game.

Rogers took down the jackpot at the blackjack table in Las Vegas, leaving with more than $1.5 million in winnings. It was a fitting end to his long and successful career in music.

"I can't believe it," Rogers said of his win. "This is such a great way to end my time on the stage."

Rogers has been playing music for more than 50 years, and has won countless awards and accolades over that time. His final performance will be later this month at the Grammy Awards show.

"It's been an amazing journey," Rogers said of his career. "But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family and friends now."

Rogers is known for hits like "The Gambler" and "Lucille". His final album, "The Last of The Good Guys", was released in 2016 and hit number one on the country charts.

# Rogers enjoys last hurrah in casino game

Broadcaster and former Conservative cabinet minister, John Rogers had a night to remember recently as he won big at the casino. The 84-year-old was playing roulette and managed to score a $37,000 payout on a single spin.

Rogers was all smiles as he recounted the story, joking that it would probably be his last hurrah at the casino. He has been known for his love of gambling in the past, but says that this big win is enough to keep him away from the tables for a while.

This windfall will no doubt come in handy for Rogers who is currently facing some financial difficulties. Earlier this year he put his $2 million home up for sale after racking up over $1 million in debt. It's unclear if he has been able to sell the property yet, but with this new influx of cash, he'll at least be able to make a dent in his outstanding balance.

Despite his recent money woes, Rogers seems to be in good spirits and content with his lot in life. He's enjoyed a long and successful career in broadcasting and politics, and is now able to enjoy his retirement years spending time with family and friends. We can only hope that he'll continue to enjoy good luck at the casino – it looks like he could really use it!

#  Kenny Rogers calls time on casino game with flourish

Slot machines will soon be removed from Foxwoods Resort Casino as part of a deal reached between the casino’s owner and singer Kenny Rogers.

Rogers, who has an ownership stake in the resort, said he wants to end his association with casino gambling before it tarnishes his legacy.

“I don’t want to be known as the guy who promoted gambling,” Rogers said in a statement.

The decision comes as no surprise to industry analysts, who say casinos are facing increasing competition from other forms of gambling, including online sports betting.

Slot machines have become less profitable in recent years, as consumers have shifted their spending towards games with higher payouts such as blackjack and roulette.

Foxwoods Resort Casino is the second-largest casino in the United States, with more than 350,000 square feet of gaming space. It is expected to remove its slot machines by the end of the year.
