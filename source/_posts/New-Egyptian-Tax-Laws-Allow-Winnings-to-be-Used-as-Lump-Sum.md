#  New Egyptian Tax Laws Allow Winnings to be Used as Lump Sum

The Egyptian government has recently announced that citizens are now allowed to use their winnings from the lottery, or other gambling activities, as a lump sum payment on their taxes. The change in the law is expected to bring in an extra $2.5 billion in revenue each year for the government.

The amendment to the tax law was made by the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, and it will apply to all forms of gambling, including lotteries, horse racing, and casino games. The winnings can be used either to pay the entire amount of your taxes owed, or as a down payment on your taxes with the remainder paid over a period of time.

This new amendment comes as part of a series of measures being put in place by the Egyptian government in an effort to increase tax revenue. In addition to this change, taxes on income and business profits have also been increased.

Egypt is not alone in its efforts to increase tax revenue from gambling activities. Countries around the world are increasingly looking at ways to tap into this potential source of income. For example, Singapore has introduced a new “corrective tax” on gambling operators which is aimed at reducing problem gambling and generating additional revenue.

The move by the Egyptian government is likely to be welcomed by taxpayers who have been struggling under increasing economic pressures in recent years. It is also likely to be popular with gamblers who now have another way to reduce their tax bill.

#  Egypt Announces New Tax Rules for Gambling Winnings

The Egyptian government has announced that it is introducing new tax rules for gambling winnings. The new rules come into effect on 1 January 2019 and will see gambling winnings taxed at a rate of 20%.

Under the old rules, gambling winnings were not considered taxable income. This meant that players could keep all of their winnings without having to pay any tax on them. However, the new rules mean that players will now have to pay 20% of their winnings in taxes.

This is likely to be a unpopular move among gamblers in Egypt, as it will result in them having to pay more tax on their winnings. However, the government has said that the new rules are necessary in order to generate additional revenue for the country.

#  Egypt Introduces Lump Sum Option for Gambling Winnings

======

On Wednesday, the government of Egypt announced a new policy that will allow people to collect their gambling winnings in a single lump sum payment. The new option is available for all types of gambling, including lotteries, horse races, and casinos.

The decision was made in an effort to attract more tourists to the country and boost its struggling economy. Egypt has been struggling since the 2011 revolution, and the introduction of this new policy is hoped to revive the tourism industry.

Critics say that the policy is likely to benefit only wealthy gamblers, as most people do not have enough money to cover a large lump sum payout. Others argue that it will simply encourage more people to gamble, leading to even greater losses for the country.

So far, there has been no official statement from the government on how much money it expects to raise from this new policy.

#  Egypt Shifts to Taxable Gambling Winnings with Lump Sum Option

The Egyptian government has approved a bill to levy taxes on gambling winnings, but with a lump-sum option for high rollers.

The new law, which was published in the country's official gazette on Sunday, will see taxes levied on all gambling winnings, regardless of the amount. However, those who earn more than 500,000 Egyptian pounds (USD $28,000) in a year can choose to pay tax on their entire income in a single lump sum.

The measure is designed to encourage high-rollers to stay in Egypt and invest their money in the country's casinos, which have been struggling in the face of competition from neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Jordan.

Under the new law, individuals earning less than 500,000 EGP will be taxed at a rate of 20%, while those earning more will be taxed at a rate of 25%. The government says that around 1.5 million Egyptians currently gamble, with the industry worth an estimated 6 billion EGP (USD $336 million) per year.

The decision to levy taxes on gambling winnings comes as part of a wider effort by the Egyptian government to boost its coffers. In March it announced plans to introduce value-added tax (VAT) of 13% on a wide range of goods and services from July 2018.

#  Taxing Gambling Winnings in Egypt: Lump Sum or Annual Payment?

Since gambling is considered a sin in Islam, Egypt has been hesitant to tax gambling winnings. In the past, any winnings were considered a gift from Allah and were not taxed. However, this exemption is no longer appropriate in today’s economy.

Gambling winnings should be taxed as regular income. There are a few possible ways to tax these winnings: a lump sum when the winnings are received, or an annual payment over a number of years. The most important factor to consider is how much revenue the government would stand to gain from taxing these winnings.

A lump sum tax would be simpler to administer, but it would likely result in less revenue for the government than an annual payment plan. Taxing gambling winnings as regular income would ensure that the government gets its fair share of the money won by gamblers. It would also help to discourage people from gambling, as they would know that they would have to pay taxes on their winnings.

Ultimately, it is up to the government of Egypt to decide how best to tax gambling winnings. However, it is clear that something needs to be done in order to generate more revenue for the country. Gambling winnings represent a valuable source of income that should not be ignored any longer.
