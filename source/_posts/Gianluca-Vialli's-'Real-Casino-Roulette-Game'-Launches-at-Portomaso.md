In a joint collaboration between two of the biggest companies on the island, Vialli’s Real Casino Roulette Game was released this week at Portomaso Casino. This new game offers casino players an enhanced gaming experience that is as close to the real thing as possible.

The brainchild of Malta’s own footballing legend Gianluca Vialli, in collaboration with Portomaso Casino, the game has been in development for over a year. The result is a realistic roulette game that offers players the chance to play against live dealers in a simulated casino environment.

Veteran Italian football manager Gianluca Vialli is making his return to the gambling industry with a new "Real Casino Roulette Game" developed in collaboration with Playtech. The game is set to debut at the ICE Totally Gaming conference in London next month, where Vialli will be on hand to promote it.

According to Vialli, the new game will allow players to enjoy all of the excitement of a real casino roulette experience from the comfort of their own homes. He explained: "The aim of this game is not just to entertain but also to give people a better understanding of how casinos work. Players can make choices that affect the result of each spin and learn about different betting strategies."

Vialli has plenty of experience in both the gambling and football worlds, having first made his name as a player for Chelsea and then managing several top clubs, including Juventus and Valencia. His move into online gambling will be seen as a major coup for Playtech, which is looking to expand its presence in the regulated Italian market.

Playtech CEO Mor Weizer was full of praise for Vialli, stating: "Gianluca is one of the most successful and well-known managers in world football and we are very excited to have him on board as our partner." Vialli himself added: "I have been involved in gaming for many years now and I am confident that Playtech's Real Casino Roulette Game offers something truly unique."

#  Gianluca Vialli Unveils 'Real Casino Roulette Game' Ahead of Portomaso Launch

Gianluca Vialli, former Chelsea and Italy striker, is back in the gambling industry with the launch of a new online casino game. The ex- footballer has announced the release of Real Casino Roulette, a web-based game that allows players to bet on real-life casino outcomes from the comfort of their own home.

"I am very excited to be launching my new Real Casino Roulette game," Vialli said in a press conference this week. "This is something that I have been working on for quite some time and I believe it offers players an unmatched gaming experience."

Vialli went on to say that the Portomaso Casino – which will power the game – is one of the most well-respected establishments in Europe. "Players can trust that they are getting a top quality experience when playing Real Casino Roulette," he added.

The launch of Real Casino Roulette comes at a time when online casinos are experiencing explosive growth worldwide. In 2017, the global online gambling market was worth an estimated $52.5 billion and is projected to reach $81.7 billion by 2020, according to research firm Zion Market Research.

It's not surprising then that many celebrities are venturing into the casino world. Recently, Paris Hilton announced plans to open her own online casino; while Calvin Harris is creating his own social media platform for gamers called Cheddi. With so much competition in the market, Vialli will need to set Real Casino Roulette apart from the rest if he wants to be successful.

So how does Real Casino Roulette differ from other online games? For starters, players can bet on real-life casino outcomes instead of just simulated results. This means that you can place bets on games such as blackjack, roulette and baccarat without ever having to leave your home. What's more, you can chat with other players in real time and watch live dealers spinning the wheel or dealing cards.

Another distinguishing feature of Real Casino Roulette is its high quality graphics and animations. The game has been designed to look and feel like you're sitting at a real life casino table – right down to the flashing lights and sound effects. This gives players an immersive experience that other games simply can't match.
