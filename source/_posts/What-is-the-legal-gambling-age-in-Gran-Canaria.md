#  What is the legal gambling age in Gran Canaria?

As with most other countries, the legal gambling age in Gran Canaria is 18 years old. This applies to both land-based and online gambling operators within the jurisdiction. Minors are not allowed to gamble under any circumstances, and violators may face penalties such as fines or imprisonment.

It’s important to note that while the legal gambling age is 18, there is no minimum age requirement for players who want to enjoy online casino games. So long as they meet all other eligibility requirements (e.g., reside in a country where online gambling is legal), anyone can play at an online casino regardless of their age.

# How strict are the penalties for underage gambling?

The penalties for underage gambling can be quite severe, particularly if players are caught participating in illegal activities. Fines and imprisonment are both common punishments for violators, though the specifics will vary from country to country. In Gran Canaria, violators can face up to six months in prison and a €5,000 fine.

Players should also be aware that prosecuting authorities may seek civil damages from parents or guardians if minors are found to have gambled illegally. This means that parents could wind up footing the bill for any fines or damages incurred by their children.
